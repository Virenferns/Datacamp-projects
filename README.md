# Datacamp-projects
Created a project that uses openAI API to respond to questions like the distance from the Louvre to the Eiffel Tower, the location of the Arc de Triomphe, and must-see artworks at the Louvre Museum. The project involved creating a list of dictionaries, called 'conversation', to set up roles and responses, starting with a 'system' message to define the model's behavior.
